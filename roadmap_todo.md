## Pending Tasks
- All pending tasks completed.
- Frontend Todo List created and GUI initialized.
- Recommendations for enhancing code quality and maintainability:
    1. Comprehensive Testing Strategy: Expand beyond basic unit tests to include:
        - Integration Tests: Verify interactions between different frontend components and with the backend API.
        - End-to-End (E2E) Tests: Use tools like Cypress or Playwright to simulate user flows and ensure the entire application works as expected.
        - Component Tests: Isolate and test individual React components to ensure they render correctly and behave as intended.
        - Accessibility Tests: Integrate tools to check for WCAG compliance to ensure the application is usable by everyone.
    2. Refine Asynchronous Error Handling: Implement a centralized error handling mechanism for API calls and other asynchronous operations in the frontend. This could involve:
        - Using error boundaries in React to catch and display UI errors gracefully.
        - Implementing global error interceptors for Axios or Fetch API to handle common error responses (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 500 Internal Server Error).
        - Providing clear and user-friendly error messages to the end-user.
    3. Enhance Structured Logging and Metrics: Implement a robust logging strategy for the frontend to capture client-side errors, performance metrics, and user interactions. Consider:
        - Using a dedicated logging library (e.g., loglevel, pino-browser) that can send logs to a centralized logging service.
        - Integrating with analytics platforms to track user behavior and application performance (e.g., Google Analytics, Sentry, Datadog).
    4. Improve Configuration Management: Externalize frontend configurations (e.g., API endpoints, feature flags) from the codebase. This allows for easier deployment across different environments (development, staging, production) without code changes. Consider using:
        - Environment variables (e.g., .env files with dotenv).
        - A dedicated configuration file that is loaded based on the environment.
    5. Code Organization and Modularity: As the frontend grows, maintain a clear and consistent folder structure. Consider:
        - Feature-based organization: Group files by feature rather than by type (e.g., src/features/todo/components, src/features/todo/hooks).
        - Atomic Design principles: Organize components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.
        - Reusable UI components: Develop a library of reusable UI components in the frontend/modules_ux_ui directory to promote consistency and reduce duplication.
    6. Performance Optimization: Continuously monitor and optimize frontend performance. This includes:
        - Code Splitting: Lazy-load components and routes to reduce initial bundle size.
        - Image Optimization: Compress and serve images in modern formats (e.g., WebP).
        - Virtualization: Use libraries like react-window or react-virtualized for rendering large lists.
        - Memoization: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
    7. Security Best Practices: Implement security measures relevant to frontend development:
        - Input Validation: Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
        - CORS Configuration: Ensure proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies are in place for API communication.
        - Dependency Auditing: Regularly audit frontend dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like npm audit.
- Frontend Modules UX/UI directories created.
